- [ ] [My current corne layout](<https://github.com/jumar/qmk_firmware/blob/8f37758ba590a4900804c16eab4d2306fdbb6931/users/jumar/jumar.h>) could be adapted for the dactyl by moving GRV from LT6_GRV to ALT_GRV on the left thumb cluster (currently ALT_BSP, but I don't use BSP here)
- [ ] Generate STLs
- [ ] Print and test one hand 
- [ ] ??
- [ ] Profit !
